# Research Institute Data Intelligence Organization

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub Organization of the Research Institute Data Intelligence. This organization comprises inquisitive faculty researchers from Zuyd University of Applied Sciences, investigating the latest insights in Data Intelligence and, in particular, applied artificial intelligence (AI).

The Research Institute Data Intelligence follows Hevner's research methodology, Design Science Research, with a focus on three key research areas: AI in healthcare, AI in industry, and Responsible AI. Stay updated on current developments through our LinkedIn page and explore new videos on YouTube.

## What does Research Institute Data Intelligence do?

Research Institute Data Intelligence is a research institute consisting of curious faculty researchers from the Technology domain at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences. They delve into the developments in the world of data intelligence and applied AI. By developing socially and regionally relevant innovations, the institute strengthens the innovation capacity of the (EU) region. Sharing knowledge in the field of applied AI contributes to this goal.

## What does Research Institute Data Intelligence aim to achieve?

Research Institute Data Intelligence aims to enable organizations to leverage AI effectively. This requires (digitally) discoverable, accessible, and usable data. Many organizations lack a well-organized data infrastructure to meaningfully implement AI. Additionally, developments in the field of AI progress rapidly, with existing techniques improving and new ones emerging. The institute aims to assist organizations in selecting the right AI approach for a given situation.

## Long-term goals

Looking ahead, Research Institute Data Intelligence recognizes a challenge in the realm of AI referred to as the "problem of control." How can humans keep increasingly intelligent (and complex) AI systems under control? How do we ensure that these AIs continue to understand and execute our intentions? The institute shares current knowledge and insights with the professionals of tomorrow (students) and informs stakeholders in the region about opportunities and risks in the field of AI.

## Collaboration

Research Institute Data Intelligence collaborates with three key stakeholders in all its activities:

1. Students (mainly but not exclusively from Zuyd University of Applied Sciences) through the DI-Lab.
2. (EU) Regional organizations involved in our education or research.
3. Faculty researchers from the Research Institute Data Intelligence itself.

We invite you to explore our repositories and join our community in advancing the understanding and application of Data Intelligence.

## Repository Management Guidelines

To ensure effective knowledge transfer and organization within the Research Institute, all code should be stored in this GitHub organization. You are required to include a readme.md file.

### Readme.md

Each GitHub repository must include a readme.md file, functioning as a user-friendly guide. This readme is not intended as a system documentation or design report but as a concise user manual for running the project demonstrator.
